# WebIPC

*WebIPC* is a technology used by **The Web 2.5** to keep communication between the server and all it's clients standardized, for the use with many different servers.

Unlike *IPC*, *WebIPC* runs on many different devices and therefore requires proper channels to communicate. It utilizes WebSockets to communicate and a simple abstraction layer for executing threads and fibers on different devices.
